They're not just pastimes; they're lifestyle choices we willingly embrace because they bring us joy and fulfillment. And I firmly believe that language learning can encompass all of that! üòç</p>\n<p>When we approach language learning with a sense of enjoyment, the results speak for themselves. Not only do we absorb information more effectively and efficiently, but we also develop a genuine connection with the language. Suddenly, studying becomes a pleasure rather than a chore, something we eagerly dive into whenever we have a spare moment. And before we know it, we're hooked!</p>\n<p>That's the approach I take with my own language learning routine, and it's what I aspire to offer you‚Äîa journey where learning Portuguese feels less like an obligation and more like a delightful pursuit.</p>\n<p>So, come along with me as we explore how to transform Portuguese learning into a hobby. Imagine studying Portuguese and barely realizing you're studying at all! Our brains are wired to absorb information more effectively when we're in a positive state of mind, so let's make it easy for our minds to embrace this beautiful language with the enthusiasm it deserves. After all, Portuguese truly is a linguistic gem! üíé</p>\n<p>Follow me on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/studyingasahobby/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">instagram</a>, subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Rhnv1flgZq-cq-yvsOQjg\">my channel</a>, and keep coming to my blog for more, of course!</p>\n<p>Obrigada and at√© logo! üòä</p>\n<p>Larissa Iris</p>\n<p>Founder, Studying as a Hobby</p>",
